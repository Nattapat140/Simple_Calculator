# Simple_Calculator
A university project (2023) that aims to help the students have a better undestanding of basic Computer Architecture by implemeting a simulation of a CPU-based calculator designed to process mathematical and logical expressions and translate them into assembly code. It serves as a hands-on exploration of low-level programming, arithmetic operations, and CPU architecture, including registers and memory management.

<h3>ðŸŒŸ Key Features </h3>
<ls>Expression Parsing:</ls>
<ul>
  <li>Support for arithmetic (+, -, *, /) and bitwise operations (&, |, ^)</li>
  <li>Increment (++, --) and compound assignment (+=, -=) operators</li>
  <li>Variables (predefined and dynamically added during execution)</li>
</ul>
<ls>Assembly Code Generation:</ls>
<ul>
  <li>Translate expressions into custom assembly instructions compatible with the given CPU</li>
  <li>Manage registers (r0-r7) and memory (256 bytes) efficiently</li>
</ul>
<ls>Performance Evaluation:</ls>
<ul>
  <li>Optimize expressions based on the clock cycles required for each instruction</li>
</ul>
<ls>Interactive Output:</ls>
<ul>
  <li>Generate a list of assembly codes that simulate the execution of the input expressions</li>
</ul>
